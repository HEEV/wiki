# Welcome to Cedarville Supermileage

## `WIP: This wiki is under construction, so please pardon the mess!`

## Who We Are
Cedarville Supermileage is a inter-disciplinary engineering team that builds hyper-efficient vehicles. We work on every part of the engineering process of all of our cars, from concept and construction, to refinement and driving, students are involved in every step. For the last couple decades, CU Supermileage has had many vehicles, with our most recent designs pictured below.

## Purpose of this Wiki
This wiki is written to prevent the problem that has plagued the team for many years. Every time someone new comes in to manage the computer team, they often do not understand what previous people have done, forcing them to start from scratch. I would like to avoid knowledge leaving the team so quickly, and thus this wiki was born. It should, when complete, contain all of the information necessary to understand our computer system, and replicate it if needed.
If something is wrong or missing, Zaine Fletcher is the author and would be happy to help with any issues in the wiki. You can reach him at his [email](mailto:zfletcher@cedarville.edu).
